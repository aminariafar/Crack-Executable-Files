# 🔍 Educational Reverse Engineering: Study Materials (Assembly & Analysis)

> ⚠️ **Ethical notice:** This repository contains materials for learning about executable file internals and basic reverse-engineering concepts **for educational and defensive purposes only**. Do **not** use these techniques to bypass software protections, commit piracy, or engage in unauthorized access. Use these materials in controlled environments, on files you own, or with explicit permission.

This project collects **assembly snippets and analysis notes** designed to teach low-level executable structure, basic disassembly, and binary analysis workflows. The content is framed as exercises and explanations to help learners understand how executables work and how analysts approach static analysis.

## ✨ Key Contents

- `part1.asm` — Assembly source demonstrating a small program flow (entry, comparison, branching). Useful for practicing disassembly and stepping through control flow.
- `asm1.txt`, `asm2.txt` — Disassembly outputs or annotated assembly dumps (plain text). These provide examples of how compiled code appears and include comments/analysis for learning.
- `part1.txt`, `part2.txt` — Step-by-step walkthroughs and explanations for the corresponding assembly snippets. They describe what each block does and highlight points of interest for analysts (e.g., string comparisons, conditional branches, and return values).
- `password.txt` — Example data used in the exercises (e.g., a sample password string for analysis practice). Treated as sample data only.

### Educational purpose & recommended use-cases
- Learn to read and interpret assembly code and disassembly listings.  
- Practice static analysis workflows in a safe, offline environment.  
- Understand common patterns in small executables (string handling, comparisons, jumps).  
- Use as teaching material in a lab or classroom setting where instructors can supervise exercises.

### What this is *not*
- This repository is **not** intended to provide tools or instructions for cracking software protections or bypassing licensing. It intentionally focuses on analysis, explanation, and defensive understanding.

If you'd like, I can:
- Expand each `part*.txt` into a clearer annotated walkthrough inside the README.  
- Convert the assembly examples into step-by-step visual explanations (control-flow diagrams).  
- Extract and present key assembly snippets with inline comments for a quick study guide.

Tell me which enhancement you want and I will add it to the README (saved as `/mnt/data/README.md`).
